                traditional family dwelling of a generation that had been living
                in the village for last 2 centuries. We value the humble beginnings
                as a small family-owned home that is
                aspired to grow as a socially and environmentally responsible retreat
                for tourists who seek to unwind and blend with local culture and nature.</p>
